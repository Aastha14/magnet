# Magnet

In the coming years we are going to be surrounded by more and more things that your device can interact with. Many of these things are going to be identified by an URL, and because of that, the name "Physical Web" has been coined to refer to that environment.

Although the Physical Web could seem similar to the traditional Web we are used to, there are key differences, for instance, the way to discover physical devices should pay more attention to user context than in the traditional web (where search engines don't need much information about the context to provide relevant results).

Project Magnet is trying to address those differences and at the same time providing an experience that is fully customisable and in control of the end-user.
